"""
The primary reason to for this module is to extend the functionality of
email.message.Message in order to work around a disagreement with Postfix
about how RFC 2047 compliant headers should be encoded when email addresses
are involved.  I don't have enough information to know who is right, but this
encodes headers in a way that is compatible with Postfix, at least, and should
be understood by any MTU.

The other purpose of this module is to fix a usability issue when using
email.message.Message with RFC 2047.  In the standard library module headers
are not automatically decoded, forcing the calling code to manually call
email.header.decode_header and then manually piece together header values.  In
this author's opinion, this is a silly way to do things.  Users of the Message
class should be able to simply assign and get back unicode values for headers
without having to know about the underlying transfer encoding.  This version
of Message makes unicode headers transparent, simplifying the calling code.
